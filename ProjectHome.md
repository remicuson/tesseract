Tesseract is a GUI library which enables GUIs to be created easily. It is written in C# with MonoDevelop, and uses an XML based markup (TIM) to describe a GUI (although you can create all controls via code if you wish). Various actions can be defined in the markup and assigned to an event, allowing the GUI to be more effectively removed from the code of the application. Most controls appearance can be modified easily by modifying various properties in the markup. Cross platform capability is an aim, with current backends targetting Gtk/Cairo and Windows Forms.
